### Assignment 1: Search and Optimization  
- **Notebook 1**: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using brute force methods.  
- **Notebook 2**: Implementation of search algorithms, including BFS, DFS, A*, and others.  

### Assignment 2: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) and Game AI  
- **Notebook 1**: Solving a CSP problem (graph coloring).  
- **Notebook 2**: Game-solving algorithms, including Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.  

### Assignment 3: Bayesian Networks  
- **Notebook 1**: Implementation of a Bayesian Network (BN) model.  
- **Notebook 2**: HNN-based Bayesian Network model for disease detection.  

### Assignment 4: Machine Learning Models  
- **Notebook 1**: Regression models.  
- **Notebook 2**: Classification methods.  
- **Notebook 3**: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the MNIST dataset.  

### Assignment 5: Reinforcement Learning (RL)  
- **Notebook 1**: General RL model implementation.  
- **Notebook 2**: RL model applied to the Mountain Car problem.  

## Projects  

### Project 1: Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
Development of a Persian movie description system. This includes fields such as genre, duration, and a short description for summarization.  

### Project 2: Deep Reinforcement Learning  
Implementation of a deep neural network-based approach for reinforcement learning. This involves training an agent to make sequential decisions to maximize cumulative rewards through interaction with its environment.
